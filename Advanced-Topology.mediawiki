The instructions are the same for this exercise as the last one. The only difference is the topology, which includes two routers controlling different subnets. 

This is an advanced exercise, and most implementation details will be left to you.

== Topology ==

You'll need a slightly different topology, something like this:

Modify your topology file to match the picture and verify full host connectivity with pingall in the Mininet console.

This is just one idea for a more advanced topology. Feel free to adjust this exercise in any way you would like. The rest is up to you, so have fun!
